%% DIJKSTRA_FUN uses Dijkstra's minimum distance algorithm.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    We essentially build a tree.  We start with only node 1 connected
%    to the tree, and this is indicated by setting CONNECTED(1) = 1.
%
%    We initialize MIND(I) to the one step distance from node 1 to node I.
%
%    Now we search among the unconnected nodes for the node MV whose minimum
%    distance is smallest, and connect it to the tree.  For each remaining
%    unconnected node I, we check to see whether the distance from 1 to MV
%    to I is less than that recorded in MIND(I), and if so, we can reduce
%    the distance.
%
%    After NV-1 steps, we have connected all the nodes to 1, and computed
%    the correct minimum distances.

%  Discussion:
%
%    We've just determined the minimum distance to node MV.
%
%    For each node I which is not connected yet,
%    check whether the route from node 1 to MV to I is shorter
%    than the currently known minimum distance.
